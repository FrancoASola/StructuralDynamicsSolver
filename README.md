# StructuralDynamicsSolver
Structural Dynamics Solver for a structure with 3 degrees of freedoms and coupled damping. <br>

# About
This was a term project for Structural Dynamics, which was an expansion of a mid-term project (Sindgle DOF solver). <br>
The solver uses Newton-Raphson iterations to solve a differential equation at each time step. This project could easily be expanded to include more degrees of freedom and could even be coded to input an arbitrary amount of DOFs (currently 3 DOFS are hard coded).
